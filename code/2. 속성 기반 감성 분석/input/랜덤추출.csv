464,galaxy_s3,2012-11-12,1,Think twice before you buy this phone,I would love this phone if it works fine. I'm user from Hong Kong. I bought the S3 and use it for three months. One night it only charged 20% and stopped. It has the charging symbol but it doesn't go up. later on it won't charge at all. (neither using the main charger and from the computer). I did search on the internet and found out so many people have the same issue all over the world. I sent it to Samsung and repaired three times. It worked fine at the beginning then it happened again. I'm still dealing with this issue. They can't fix it right but they refuse to replace the new one. How can Samsung sell a defect product and refuse to exchange? They support is terrible. Next time I will just get an iphone at least they will replace a new one. I was thinking buy the Samsung smart tv but now I will never buy any Samsung product again.
73787,galaxy_s10e,2022-10-01,5,i love this phone.,"i am an apple person, but wanted to switch. i love this phone. it's easy to use and is a nice size for a smaller hand. touch screen works really well. not too sensitive just enough."

20028,galaxy_s6,2017-07-05,5,Fast Phone! 5 stars!,"The Samsung Galaxy S Series is my favorite line! This phone is fast. At first I was a little worried about it being a certified refurbished item, but after playing with it, it works like a new phone! The price is amazing as well, thank goodness it has dropped in price. You know the specs, so I do not need to relist them here, but a very nice spec list. 64GB is needed in phones now-a-days and I would not get less.This phone can also take a beating. Granted I have an otterbox on it, it has fallen many times with not 1 crack or scratch! I will buy another refurbished item again!Pros:+ Fast Processor+ Much Storage+ Durable+ Nice Camera+ Good Battery Life+ Samsung Pay!+ Great PriceI don't have any Cons for this phone yet, but it is a great phone!"

16770,galaxy_s5,2017-12-08,5,Works excellent.,It's always tricky buying older model phones from third party sellers. So I was happy to receive this T Mobile edition Galaxy in its original packaging perfect condition AND unlocked. Saves a lot of stress knowing the phone I'm ordering is what it's supposed to be and doesn't have any problems and isn't locked by the carrier. If you want a reliable buy I'd suggest this company.
71222,iphone_xs_max,2022-09-03,1,DONT BUY,"iPhone started malfunction a couple months after I purchased the phone. I have took very good care of it. Never once dropped or laid a scratch on it. Slowly the phone started to break down suddenly overnight! One day the camera stopped working, a couple months later Face ID stopped working! This is ridiculous. I will probably never buy renewed again. The seller definitely sold me a defective device."
71550,iphone_xs_max,2020-05-01,5,Money well spent,"Was skeptical at first buying a refurbished phone, but no regrets!!! Best $600 I’ve spent in a long time."
53061,iphone7,2019-08-08,5,Would buy from this seller again,Item worked great. Great condition
50186,iphone7,2018-04-29,5,Would buy again,"I figured it was worth the risk if I saved $150-$200 from an Apple refurbished or new iPhone. My phone came in an unmarked white box with charging cord. The screen is perfect, there were two very small areas of dent/scratches in the body of the phone by two corners. The camera works perfectly from what I can tell so far. It works with my carrier Ting. I am very pleased and think that this is a great value!"

45974,iphone6s,2018-10-09,3,"Home button is loose, but the rest is great.","Everything about the phone is in great shape (even the battery is new), but the home button is loose and has this annoying double-click that you can feel and hear when pushing it. It’s getting worse over time. I’m wondering if this issue is the original reason why the phone was returned.I don’t want to have to return the phone because I don’t have a backup phone anymore, and, I’m afraid the replacement would have a worse battery or be in worse cosmetic condition.  I’m hoping the seller will reach out to me and work out a local repair so I don’t have to ship off the phone."
7141,galaxy_s4,2014-09-25,3,Good phone missing parts,Phone works good but the cover for the light on the back is missing.

One of the main reasons why we upgraded from our older S3s was to get better reception, but now our major complaint is worse reception than we had before.. Our provider carefully checked everything at their end and determined that the problem is with the device itself.Why did we bother?"
72806,iphone_xs_max,2021-03-08,5,Amazing,I can’t take a picture of it but it so amazing I won’t be getting a new phone for a while because I like this one so much

12901,galaxy_s5,2015-05-15,1,I am so upset about this phone. I bought ...,I am so upset about this phone. I bought it online for a penny. I thought it was so inexpensive due to the fact that the Samsung 6 was coming out. My screen without having dropped it became discolored and had lines across it. I had this phone for less than 1 month and It was placed in an otterbox immediately. Now sprint will give me a new phone which is refurbished however this phone had to be refurbished to have broken so quickly.
13803,galaxy_s5,2015-10-16,4,Four Stars,Very good phone. Meet my expectation. Will recommend to friends.
54303,iphone7,2019-12-06,5,The phone is performing as promised!,The verdic is still out on the overall performance and quality of this re-newed iPhone 7. The only minor issue I have is the battery life.  I’m curious about the first 30-90 days.  But if the phones continues to perform as I initially purchased then I would give the process from purchasing to use 5 stars!

Called my carrier to find out if it was a problem with the network but it turns out that the phone that I purchased had a blacklisted IMEI, basically meaning that the phone was stolen/ locked for use before being sold to me. Very upset to be receiving a product like that and returned it instantly."

14253,galaxy_s5,2016-02-05,5,I love it's multi-function capabilities,I have had this phone for about a year and have experienced no problems. This phone does so many things as I'am still learning new stuff a year later. It has the capability to allow you to be on the phone with someone and still able to browse the web to look up phone numbers or anything you need you can also send a text while speaking to someone on the phone. I love it's multi-function capabilities all the various options you have to personalize it to your needs the sturdiness of it and most of all the waterproof feature. The charging port has a cover on it and as long as it's sealed up and you accidently drop it in water your good. I have dropped mine in water twice and grabbed it out quickly and it never hurt it. I highly recommend this phone to everyone.

15366,galaxy_s5,2016-09-14,5,I work for Verizon,"I'm a sales consultant for Verizon Wireless FYI. This is by one of the best phones Samsung has released in terms of a ""removable"" battery. The newer phones you do not have that option but this one you can and it will STILL run all the current apps AND perform fast just like the newest phones!"
75115,galaxy_s10e,2020-01-20,2,great idea but had to return the phone.,"i received the u.s. unlocked version and it seemed brand new with no scratches. most functions worked great including phone calls, wifi, and data connections. however all text messages failed to send on the at&t network. i tried several troubleshooting steps including confirming that the apn and message center number were correct, removing and reinserting the sim card but it just would not send text messages."

7661,galaxy_s4,2015-01-28,5,Kept my current Verizon contract,Took the SIM card out of my Droid RAZR and stuck it in this S4 and it 10 seconds I got a text from Verizon congratulating me on my new phone. It works without any changes to my existing data/voice plan (still unlimited). Packaging was all original and the phone works great.
11126,galaxy_s5,2014-11-06,3,they say that even the phone is international version the LTE band from this phone is not useful in some providers of different,The product met my expectations partially since the LTE band doesn't work in my area (Uruguay). Despite the local company provides the LTE service they say that even the phone is international version the LTE band from this phone is not useful in some providers of different countries. This is very sad.

So I kept it one more day to see if the battery could be better, but I am very disappointed. I went out to take some vedio, which was about 30 miniutes long, then the battery was too low to run. I had to come back to charage my  phone.  By the way when I left the house it was fully charged."

36241,iphone5,2013-03-24,1,Apple Needs to Step-up !!!,Review from India. My phone usage is high further I read lots of news and surf the Internet. Iphone 5 was a dream having seen my cousins and friends use apple products. I was aware of the closed apple environment no memory upgrade no battery change and probably one of the most expensive phones in the market (apple premium). I faced the following issues that made me change my mind. After a full charge the phone was 25% at 2 pm and completely drained by 4 pm. This is after manually shutting off all apps navigation and wifi. I had to carry three chargers for my house car office and a fourth emergency battery pack in my bag just to make it last the day. I found it to heat up when used for internet surfing even for 5 mts. When I went to the local Apple store they told me that the heating issue can be rectified if I use a case and since the battery depending on usage. When I did some reading I realised iphone has a 1440mAh battery while the. Galaxy S III has a beefier 2100mAh. There is a battery drain issue that apple is planning to fix. This issues was not faced by my friends who have use S G 3 or SG4 or HTC One or other phones. My old BB bold give me full days worth of talk and surf with still lot off juice in the night. After spending 900 usd (@ Rs 56) I don't think I could be expected carry a charger or buy a case. My feel is apple will rectify these issues in the next phone. Meanwhile I have moved on.
7186,galaxy_s4,2014-10-11,1,it hit to the ground on the corner and screen got cracked like a spider web,One time I dropped off accidentally it hit to the ground on the corner and screen got cracked like a spider web. I have dropped my iPhone many times and it did not break like Samsung

33327,iphone4s,2014-05-08,2,Works fine but dies before the battery dies,Once the phone gets to 30% or less of battery it just shuts off randomly. Sometimes I can get it back on but usually it's just gone until it's charged again. Use a different seller.
4557,galaxy_s3,2015-05-21,5,Five Stars,Works great and a great price

I am really happy for my new phone.
65972,iphone_xs,2023-03-25,5,"Affordable, great phone!","My daughter was using my very old iPhone 8. It had many problems when I used it, and it had only gotten worse after her years of use. However, I could not justify spending $500+ on a new phone for her. When I came across these on Amazon, I was intrigued but hesitant. The reviews were great though, and it came with a 90 day return, so I decided it was worth the shot. I bought it in November, and gave it to her for Christmas 2022. It’s now March 2023 and she has had no issues with it whatsoever. Everything works great on it, the battery life is great! I am so thankful I found this great, and very affordable phone!"

29524,iphone4,2013-05-15,5,My first iPhone,While some people have been using the iPhone since the day it premiered I waited for it to come to verizon. While I have been a long time apple fan this is truly the best product I could have imagined. I use it as a phone a mini-mini ipad and ipod and most of all a gps! This iPhone is fast secure and reliable. The battery life is surprisingly long considering how often I use it and how many apps I frequently run at the same time. By far my favorite phone that I have ever owned. The apps on itunes are not a diverse as on android which is the one big downfall. And I have yet to find a good app that actually blocks calls which was easy to do with an android. The only other thing I miss from an android is that there isn't a slide out keyboard. I do find that I don't love the touch screen keyboard for fast texting and sending emails.

I trusted that this business was reputable.
4981,galaxy_s3,2015-11-14,5,Great phone for the price.,I love this phone. I know it isn't the most current smart phone but it more than meets my needs and expectations. The size is a bit bigger than my old basic phone but still fits in my pocketbook or pants pocket. I'm slowly learning all the aspects of this phone and so far all the features are great.
40025,iphone5,2015-12-23,5,Its Apple Quality,I got thing to use with Ting awhile back. It is everything you'd expect from an iPhone in build quality and ease of use. In my opinion the 5 is the most solid all around phone they've made. The great thing about Apple products is if you take care of them they have a pretty solid resale.
